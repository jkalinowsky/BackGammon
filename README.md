# Backgammon Game - Basics of Programming Project
### Introduction
Backgammon Game - made with C mixed with C++ and conio2 library. This projects mark a milestones as it represents my first bigger project in this technology. While it may not be perfect or highly sophisticated, it servers a valuable marker of my progress.

## Project Overview
### Backgammon
The project centers around the classic board game, Backgammon. Players can enjoy a game against the computer, providing a simple yet engaging experience to apply the programming concepts learned during the Basics of Programming course.

### Technology Stack
**C** - The primary programming language used for implementing the game logic and functionality.
**Conio2** - A simple library for console input and output in C, which facilitates the creation of a graphical interface in a console environment.

### Features
**Gameplay** : Play a full game of Backgammon - player vs player.
**User Interface** : Utilize the conio2 library to create a basic console interface.
**Progress Tracking** : his project serves as a tangible representation of my growth as a programmer in the realm of C.
